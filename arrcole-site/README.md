This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployed on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Intent

This site will be used to as the portfolio site. Come back and updated it once a month with a new recommendation and update projects you are working on

## TO DO LIST

We need to build a comprehensive table of things that users can see as an appendix. Not sure if that should be a page or just another card that is expandable and queryable as  table. 
We also want to create a more userfriendly way to read my writing pieces. Not sure if it should be a substack? Or just a thing to I host and people can use for free? Not sure.
